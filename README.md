## About me 👋

I'm a passionate software developer with deep expertise in Bluetooth technology and proficiency in multiple programming languages.

Throughout my career, I've specialized in Bluetooth, from designing and implementing complete stacks in C to contributing to the Android Bluetooth stack at Google. This experience has given me in-depth knowledge of most Bluetooth layers—though I admit, it's pretty niche 🥸

In my free time, I dive deeply into Rust programming and occasionally explore Zig.
